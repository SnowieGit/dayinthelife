   <br>
   <p>Bonnie Scott is a soon-to-be empty nester trying to squeeze every bit
     of fun out of life with her two daughters before they go away to college
     in two weeks.  Sunday, August 5 was National Sister's Day 2018.  It was
     also a day of life's simple pleasures.</p>

       <p> 6:10 a.m.</p>
       <p>
         Wake up to the sound of barking and giggling. A 45lb samoyed and 15
         pekingese are fighting over the spot on the floor next to Patra, my
         soon-to-be college freshman.  As I walk down the hall, I yell to my
          oldest, Patrice to take Snowie, the sammi outside.  Patra and Lola
         continue exercising.  I peek in the living room.
       </p>
       <p>
         "It's National Sister's Day," Patra exhales between sit-ups."
         "Great! That gives you and your sister a good excuse to give Snowie
         and Lola a good brushing this morning.  You and your sister
         can take them for a long walk after breakfast. They're sisters too
         afterall.  Let them enjoy their day."
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>
         6:15 a.m.-7:00a.m.</p>
         <p>
           The three of us prepare and eat breakfast. We also laugh and share
           our various social media feeds.

             Call my own sister, Lynn, tell her it's National Sisters Day
            and arrange to meet up for an 11:00 early movie.Then shower and
            get dressed so I don't have to compete for bathroom space when
            girls have finished brushing the dogs.

                     then fixes us some high protein smoothies.  Patrice around
                     Patra clown around at the front desk while I sneak in a
                     workout and walk on the ellipticals since I have a member-
                     ship.

                   We all check our McDonald's Apps and discover Free Fries
                   today!  (Free large fries at that).  So we walk around the
                   corner to McDonalds and place our orders.  We shoot
                   the breeze and I take a picture of the two sisters, my two
                   daughters to commemmorate the day.</p>
