   <h1>A Day in the Life - Celebrating Sisters</h1>
   <h2>Bonnie Scott</h2>
   <p>Bonnie Scott is a soon-to-be empty nester trying to squeeze every bit
     of fun out of life with her two daughters before they go away to college
     in two weeks.  Sunday, August 5 was National Sister's Day 2018.  It was
     also a day of life's simple pleasures.</p>
     <blockquote>
       "All siblings have the odd argument here and there, but deep down there's
       little way around the natural connection between siblings.  Cherish the
         memories and make plans to create new ones.  Reconnect or patch up any
         misunderstandings.  Sisters are forever"
       </blockquote>
