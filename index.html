  <h1>A Day in the Life: Observing Three Sets of Sisters</h>


      <h2>Bonnie Scott</h2>
   <br>
   <p>Sunday, August 5 was National Sister's Day 2018.  It was
     also a relaxing day of simple pleasures for three sets of sisters.</p>

          <br>
     <h3>Start</h3>
     <br>
     <blockquote>
       "All siblings have the odd argument here and there, but deep down there's
       little way around the natural connection between siblings.

       <p> 8:10 a.m.</p>
       <p>
         Barking and giggling.  Giggling and barking. That's how I wake up
         every morning.  "Take those bitches out for a walk,"I say to Patrice,
         my oldest daughter, as I roll over and see her stroll past my room.
         "Patra too?" she asks.  "You know I didn't mean your sister," I reply.
         Making my way towards the living room, I see a 45lb samoyed and 15 lb
         pekingese wrestling for the spot on the floor next to my youngest
         daughter.
       </p>
       <p>
         "It's National Sister's Day," Patra exhales between sit-ups."

         "Great! That gives you and your sister a good excuse to brush Snowie
         and Lola and give them baths before you take off this morning.

         "I didn't say National Give Your Dog a Bath Day,"Patra replied.

         "No, you didn't.  But since they're siblings, spruce them up and
         give them a lot of TLC before you and your sister run off today."

         "Well, since Patrice and I are going to be bathing dogs and going
         to work, what will you be doing today?"

         "I'm going to go back to sleep and then meet up with my sister."

       <p>
         8:15 a.m.
         <p>
           Back in my bed falling asleep to the sweet sounds of my girls
           arguing and laughing and barking and yapping and splishing and
           splashing on the morning of National Sister's Day 2018.

             Call my own sister, Lynn, tell her it's National Sisters Day
            and arrange to meet up for an 11:00 early movie.Then shower and
            get dressed so I don't have to compete for bathroom space when
            girls have finished brushing the dogs.

                     then fixes us some high protein smoothies.  Patrice around
                     Patra clown around at the front desk while I sneak in a
                     workout and walk on the ellipticals since I have a member-
                     ship.

                   We all check our McDonald's Apps and discover Free Fries
                   today!  (Free large fries at that).  So we walk around the
                   corner to McDonalds and place our orders.  We shoot
                   the breeze and I take a picture of the two sisters, my two
                   daughters to commemmorate the day.</p>
