   <br>
   <p>Bonnie Scott is a soon-to-be empty nester trying to squeeze every bit
     of fun out of life with her two daughters before they go away to college
     in two weeks.  Sunday, August 5 was National Sister's Day 2018.  It was
     also a day of life's simple pleasures.</p>

       <p> 6:10 a.m.</p>
       <p>
         Wake up to the sound of barking and giggling. A 45lb samoyed and 15
         pekingese are fighting over the spot on the floor next to Patra, my
         soon-to-be college freshman.  As I walk down the hall, I yell to my
          oldest, Patrice to take Snowie, the sammi outside.  Patra and Lola
         continue exercising.  I peek in the living room.
       </p>
       <p>
         "It's National Sister's Day," Patra exhales between sit-ups."
         "Great! That gives you and your sister a good excuse to give Snowie
         and Lola a good brushing this morning.  You and your sister
         can take them for a long walk after breakfast. They're sisters too
         afterall.  Let them enjoy their day."
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>
         6:15 a.m.-7:00a.m.</p>
         <p>
           The three of us prepare and eat breakfast. We also laugh and share
           our various social media feeds.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
           7:00-8:00</p>
           Clean kitchen, and as many other cleaning tasks as can fit into
           an hour. </p>
           <br>
           <p>8:00-8:45 a.m.</p>
           <p>
             Call my own sister, Lynn, tell her it's National Sisters Day around
            and arrange to meet up for an 11:00 early movie.Then shower around
            get dressed so I don't have to compete for bathroom space when
            girls have finished brushing the dogs.
            <p>
